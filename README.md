## Features

✨ Explore the platform capabilities that centralize your vulnerability intelligence.

### **Unified Intelligence Hub**
Access everything in one place:
- 📊 **Comprehensive Vulnerability Data** - Complete CVE information and details
- 🎯 **Exploitability Markets** - Real-world exploit availability tracking
- 📈 **EPSS Scores** - Exploit Prediction Scoring System for risk prioritization
- 🛡️ **CISA KEV Integration** - Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog
- 📦 **Product & Package Mapping** - Affected software and version tracking

### **Advanced Threat Intelligence**
- 🌐 **Multi-Source Enrichment** - Aggregated data from leading exploit databases

## Risk Scoring

📊 CveMate calculates an **Overall Risk Score** (0-100) for each vulnerability by combining multiple threat indicators.

The score is further adjusted by conditional rules that handle specific threat scenarios like active exploitation campaigns, AI-detected emergencies, and critical severity combinations.
