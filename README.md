## 📊 Risk Scoring

CveMate calculates an **Overall Risk Score** (0-100) for each vulnerability by combining multiple threat indicators.

The score is further adjusted by conditional rules that handle specific threat scenarios like active exploitation campaigns, AI-detected emergencies, and critical severity combinations.
