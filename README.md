<h1 align="center">CveMate</h1>

Simple, but enhanced vulnerability insights.

CveMate streamlines vulnerability management by consolidating critical security intelligence into a single, intuitive platform. Instead of juggling multiple sources and databases, security teams can access comprehensive vulnerability data, exploitability markets, EPSS scores, CISA KEV listings, and affected products and packages—all in one place.

CveMate also incorporates experimental cyber threat intelligence from darkweb sources, offering early warnings about vulnerabilities being actively discussed or traded in the dark.
